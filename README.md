## Welcome

My name is Chinwe, and I enjoy meeting new people and finding ways to help them have an uplifting experience. I have had a variety of programming opportunities, through which I was able to create and develop applications. I am dedicated, outgoing, and a team player. Who speaks in minor seminars and instructs in workshops. I love seeing people smile and also  putting their efforts and skills to good use. Funny enough I try not to be a social media enthusiast.
